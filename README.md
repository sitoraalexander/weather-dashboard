## Weather Dashboard

Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. 

## Challenge:

The challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

## API:

OpenWeather API (https://openweathermap.org/api) is used to retrieve weather data for cities. 

## Review: 

* URL of the deployed application: https://sitoraalexander.github.io/weather-dashboard/

* The URL of the GitHub repository: https://github.com/sitoraalexander/weather-dashboard

## How it works:

* When you search for a city
* You are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
* When you  view current weather conditions for that city
* You are presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
* When you view the UV index
* You are presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
* When you view future weather conditions for that city
* You are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
* When you click on a city in the search history
* You are again presented with current and future conditions for that city
* When you open the weather dashboard
* You are presented with the last searched city forecast
